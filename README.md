# tic-tac-toe-in-java


The TicTacToe class represents the game board and handles player moves, checks for a win or draw, and switches players.
The Main class runs the game, allowing players to make moves until there is a winner or the board is full.
The game is played in the console, and players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column.
The program checks for win conditions after each move and announces the winner or a draw at the end of the game.
